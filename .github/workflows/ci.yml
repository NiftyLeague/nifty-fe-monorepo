    # This concurrency setting allows multiple workflows to run at the same time,
    # as long as they are for different branches. This is useful for pull requests
    # since we want to validate them as quickly as possible.
    #
    # The `cancel-in-progress` option will cancel any existing workflows with
    # the same name and ref, so we don't end up with multiple workflows running
    # at the same time for the same branch.
