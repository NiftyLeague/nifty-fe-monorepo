<summary>What is the purpose / utility of Nifty League comics?</summary>

Comics were free gifts to reward our early holders!

Each comic can be burned for in-game wearables or weapons. Note: each comic corresponds with a specific item, some more rare than others. A full set of comics, 1-6, can also be exchanged for a Citadel Key.

<summary>Can I still claim comics?</summary>

No, all claims are now closed. Comics are available on Immutable zkEVM secondary marketplaces such as [TokenTrove](https://tokentrove.com/collection/NiftyLeague)

The snapshot for Comics 5 and 6 was taken at [Ethereum Block 14115835](https://etherscan.io/block/14115835). Each DEGEN held at the snapshot received a comic 5 claim. Each tribe set, and meta background, received a comic 6 claim. Legendary DEGENs held at the snapshot received a claim for two comic 6s.

Comics 1-4 were airdropped as minting promotions immediately following the mint.
