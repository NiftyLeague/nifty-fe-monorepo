<summary>What is the utility/function of DEGEN backgrounds?</summary>

Backgrounds come with special perks such as a distinguished look in game and occasional extra bonuses or rewards in-game.

<details>
<summary>Why is the DEGEN rename asking for multiple verifications?</summary>

Renaming a character costs 1k NFTL, which is immediately burned by the Nifty Degen smart contract. In order to enable the contract to spend your NFTL, you will initially need to increase the spending allowance by at least 1k NFTL. By default, this approval is set to 1k but if you plan on renaming multiple characters you can increase the allowance to avoid having to increase the allowance in the future.
