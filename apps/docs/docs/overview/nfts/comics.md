### Airdrop

The Nifty League Comic Collection consists of 6 pages of Comics. Our Comic NFTs are all ERC-1155â€™s.

During minting, we surprised the community with a special Nifty League launch Comic Collection to say thank you for minting our collection and for being early. Snapshots for Comics were taken throughout the minting process for the first 4 Comic pages at the following milestones:

- **Comic 1** - 2500
- **Comic 2** - 3500
- **Comic 3** - 5000
- **Comic 4** - 7500

There was a snapshot on 1/31/2022 for **Comic 5** awarded to all DEGEN holders, and **Comic 6** awarded to all wallets containing all 6 DEGEN tribes.

In addition, all [Meta background](/docs/overview/nfts/degens/backgrounds) DEGENs received one **Comic 6** NFT, and all [Legendary background](/docs/overview/nfts/degens/backgrounds) DEGENs received two **Comic 6** NFTs.
