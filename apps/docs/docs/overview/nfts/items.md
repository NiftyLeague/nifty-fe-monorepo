The initial 6 in-game items are earned via burning [comic pages](./comics). These 6 items have some of the highest power-scores in game, granting holders a strong early advantage in games.

### Weapons

Powerful bats or other weapons used in various Nifty League games such as [Nifty Smashers](/docs/overview/games/mobile-games/nifty-smashers).

### Immutable (IMX) Items Marketplace

Items were originally minted on Immutable blockchain but will soon be migrated to Immutable zkEVM on Polygon. Stay Tuned for future details!

After the migration we will set up an official marketplace for our items so users can easily interact and purchase additional items for use in our games.
