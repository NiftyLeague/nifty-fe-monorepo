### Immutable (IMX) Items Marketplace

Items were originally minted on Immutable blockchain but will soon be migrated to Immutable zkEVM on Polygon. Stay Tuned for future details!

After the migration we will set up an official marketplace for our items so users can easily interact and purchase additional items for use in our games.
