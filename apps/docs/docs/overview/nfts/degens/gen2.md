The idea of additional tribes has been floated since our humble beginnings, often requested by core community members. The reality is this decision will ultimately come down to demand. We have no intention to dilute our current NFT holders if there is no need to.

It is important to note that the unique trait combinations from our genesis DEGENs will **_never_** be mintable again, and any new generation of characters would be designed with completely new tribes and traits altogether.

We are constantly monitoring demand on other blockchains as well, and may consider expanding to other EVM-compatible chains in order to onboard new users and enable cross-chain gaming. And of course, we wouldn't forget our genesis DEGENs if this decision was ever made!
