DEGEN backgrounds were randomly assigned upon minting, which either resulted in a **Common** background or one of three special backgrounds: **Rare**, **Meta**, **Legendary**.

Being the only completely randomized DEGEN trait, special backgrounds naturally became the most sought-after DEGENs in our collection. At least until Hydras arrived...

:::tip[Note]

Backgrounds come with occasional special perks such as a distinguished look in game, additional airdrop allocations, or in-game multipliers.
