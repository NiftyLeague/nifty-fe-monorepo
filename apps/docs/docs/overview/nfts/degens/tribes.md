### Hydra - DEGEN Burn

The Mint-O-Matic mint was capped to 9,900 DEGENs with 98 spots leftover for a mysterious 7th tribe... In Feb 2023, the rare 7th tribe was finally revealed as the ancient Hydras came back from extinction.

DEGEN holders lined up to send 8 DEGENs through a portal forever burning their existence from the blockchain. In return? A claim at one of 98 rare Hydra eggs.

Hydras are amphibious water dragons that roam freely underwater or on land. Their cuteness belies their wise and fighting prowess. They pack a punch with their tridents, spears, and ranged attacks and bring a wealth of lore knowledge to Nifty League, being the oldest tribe.

### 1 of 1s

Following the Hydra claim we held a NFTL raffle for the final 2 DEGENS - both unique and very special tribes, RugMan & Satoshi. Holders of these special tokens are granted the highest perks available in the NiftyVerse.
