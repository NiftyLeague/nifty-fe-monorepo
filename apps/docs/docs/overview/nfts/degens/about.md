Nifty League introduced a unique minting experience for the genesis drop in September 2021, which the community absolutely loved! Users were able to design their own DEGEN NFTs using our Mint-O-Matic, with a set of traits of their choosing.

There are 7 tribes of DEGENs: apes, humans, dogs, frogs, cats, aliens, and hydra. Hydra is the rarest tribe and only one not available during the initial mint. A DEGEN's tribe determines certain in-game mechanics and special moves available in each Nifty League game.

Each DEGEN's design affected the pool of available character traits and accessories. Minters were able to browse through already minted DEGENs to determine which tribes were rarer than others and what type of DEGEN they gravitated toward.

Although our NFTs minted out in October 2021, they can be purchased on the secondary market via [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/niftydegen).
