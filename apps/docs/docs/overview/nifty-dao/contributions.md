### Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe you'd like a new feature? Take a look at **GitHub Discussions** for the repository to see if it's already being discussed. You can help us by submitting an issue on GitHub. Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**

   that relate to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Fork the project
