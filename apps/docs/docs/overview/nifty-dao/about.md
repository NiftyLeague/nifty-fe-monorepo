### Overview

Nifty League is undergoing a transformative journey towards decentralization emphasizing Nifty DAO as the future of the platform's evolution. This strategic shift aims to cultivate rapid growth and development through the collaborative efforts of developers and artists within the community. Simply put, DAOs are the future. Beyond making great games, we see only one route to becoming the world's leading gaming platform and that’s by building together. At the core of this transformation is [NFTL](/docs/overview/nifty-dao/nftl/overview), the native governance token, providing voting rights and multifaceted utilities.

### Goals

The DEGEN community continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the platform's roadmap and influencing game development. The ultimate goal is to evolve into a fully decentralized DAO, supported by developers and creators globally. Nifty DAO’s responsibility is to reward contributors for their accomplishments, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.

Nifty League invites indie game studios to participate in expanding the platform with engaging games, leveraging the support of the DEGEN community and our product offerings. Exciting partnerships have been forged with some of the largest web3 brands globally, aiming to expand the player community, drive content growth loops, and enhance awareness and engagement across the Nifty League ecosystem. Game developers can leverage our community to pitch game ideas, receiving upfront funding or long-term royalties upon approval.

In alignment with this vision, the platform is working towards establishing a more formal process for indie gaming studios and artists to integrate assets or games into NiftyVerse. The first trial is ongoing with the development of Nifty Royale in collaboration with a third-party game studio. Nifty League anticipates a significant push towards open-sourcing and decentralization over the next years, contributing to a collaborative and decentralized gaming landscape.

### Funds

The envisioned DAO will feature a treasury funded with NFTL/ETH & NFTL/IMX liquidity, control over future NFTL minting, and open-ended proposals. The DAO's treasury assets, currently managed through a Gnosis multi-sig wallet on Ethereum mainnet, will facilitate distributions to future contributors, tournaments, or other approved proposals. The treasury will eventually be migrated to Immutable zkEVM to benefit from lower fees for voting and distributions to contributors.

To ensure transparent operations, the core team is actively seeking notable community members to join the multi-sig committee, responsible for treasury operations and enforcing on-chain proposals aligned with the evolving DAO guidelines. Please contact a community moderator in [Discord](https://discord.gg/niftyleague) for more information.

Plans for the DAO include utilizing Tally.xyz for proposals and token voting, drawing inspiration from successful DAOs on their platform like Uniswap and AAVE.
