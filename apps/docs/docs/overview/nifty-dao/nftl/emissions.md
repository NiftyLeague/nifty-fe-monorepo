### DEGEN Holders - _750M NFTL_

250M NFTL is distributed annually over the first 3 years to all genesis [DEGEN NFT](/docs/overview/nfts/degens/about) owners at a rate of **68.5 NFTL per day**.

**There is no need to stake your [DEGEN NFT](/docs/overview/nfts/degens/about) to earn daily NFTL.**

DEGEN owners may claim their NFTL on our website at any time by visiting their [Profile](https://app.niftyleague.com/profile). NFTL is associated with each DEGEN, not your wallet address. Meaning - selling before claiming will tranfer any claimable NFTL to the new owner.

Claiming your DEGEN's earned NFTL means moving the token to your preferred crypto wallet (gas must be paid to perform this action).

### SushiSwap Liquidity Incentives - _30M NFTL_

30M NFTL was allocated for liquidity incentives along with SUSHI tokens as part of their Onsen program. Those who provided NFTL/ETH liquidity and staked their LP token on [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/) were elligible to claim while supplies lasted. This program is now complete and no NFTL is left to be claimed.

### Play-2-Earn (P2E) - _70M NFTL_

To bootstrap [Nifty Smashers](/docs/overview/games/mobile-games/nifty-smashers) and encourage new players to test our system we introduced p2e rewards for a limited time. This program is now complete and no NFTL p2e options are intended to available in our games going forward.
