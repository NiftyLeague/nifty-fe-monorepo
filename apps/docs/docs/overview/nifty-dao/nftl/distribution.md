### Team - _30M NFTL_

100M NFTL was initially allocated for a team development fund, time-locked for 6 months from [Block #13228502](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3649b00464903b78608f8de9308aec339ecd7446f1dc2de26a9913d2d5468ecf). However, 70% of these tokens were reallocated for new VCs (below). The 30M remaining NFTL tokens have been released to the team and are held with the intent to retain some voting power in the Nifty DAO.

### VCs - _135.5M NFTL_

On March 2, 2022 we annouced our first raise led by [RSE Ventures](https://rseventures.com/), a New York-based private investment firm founded by Stephen M. Ross and Matt Higgins. In total 135.5M NFTL were set aside for our only private round / NFTL sale to date. More info in our [Medium Blog](https://niftyleague.medium.com/nifty-league-raises-5-million-seed-investment-round-led-by-rse-ventures-to-expand-its-nft-gaming-2e28a9972c5e).

These tokens included 2 year vesting terms, which by now are fully vested.

### Nifty DAO - _95.9M NFTL_

Our team bootstrapped the [Nifty League DAO Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd06ae6fb7eade890f3e295d69a6679380c9456c1) with NFTL along with $250K Ethereum (ETH).

The initial planned distribution was 125M NFTL, however 142M leftovers from unclaimed AXS airdrop & DEGEN NFT Holders (below) were returned to the DAO as well. The DAO burned 35M NFTL on [April 15th, 2022](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4e3f1177bd5288240039176a948c632e8027acc31f475d78a30bad47e5f9470b) and a large majority of remaining NFTL was re-allocated to our P2E system, and for SushiSwap liquidity incentives (more on [emissions](./emissions)).

In total the DAO retained 95.9M NFTL, most of which has been used to provide NFTL/ETH liquidity on [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/) & [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/).

### Marketing - _8M NFTL_

In order to foster a strong community, early community members who went above and beyond contributing to discussions or memes recieved NFTL tips. To facilitate this, we configured a [Discord tip bot](https://tip.cc/) for our team and community moderators to tip DEGENs in the server. A combined total of 7M NFTL was spent via the tip bot over the first two months post-mint.

Axie Infinity was one of our early inspirations. To commemorate this we had an early claimable airdrop for AXS governance token holders. The airdrop included holders based on a snapshot taken at [Block #13360120](https://etherscan.io/block/13360120). Note, a total of 256K NFTL were claimed while the AXS airdrop contract was open. In October 2021, we decided to close our AXS holders airdrop early, sending remaining tokens to the Nifty DAO.

The remaining marketing allocation was provided for Twitch streamers in the Web3 space to showcase [Nifty Smashers](/docs/overview/games/mobile-games/nifty-smashers).

### DEGEN Owners - _180.5M NFTL_

215M NFTL was made available to claim for early DEGEN NFT holders. Of that roughly 35M was left unclaimed and returned to the Nifty DAO, resulting in 180.5M total initial allocation.

### Final Initial Supply - _450M NFTL_

This brought the initial NFTL supply to around 450M with daily emissions for all genesis NFT owners starting immediately after, as well as other liquidity or gaming incentives. Learn more on the next page!
