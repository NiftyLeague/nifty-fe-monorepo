Arcade Tokens were initially intoduced back in 2022 as a way to play for rewards in our first on-chain mini-games, [WEN Game](./wen-game) & [Crypto Winter](./crypto-winter). This system is since **deprecated**, however, Mini Games & Arcade Tokens are being brought back to life in all our mobile game titles, including [NiftyVerse](/docs/overview/games/niftyverse).

:::tip[Note]

Arcade Tokens are off-chain and not an ERC-20 Token.

:::

The premise for Arcade Tokens is to reward players for returning to the game. Every day players login they receive 1 Arcade Token to use in a mini-game of their choosing. Play matches and additional Arcade Tokens will be rewarded.

After each mini-game your score is tallied to determine how many tickets you earned. These tickets opperate much like a traditional arcade would, providing you a shop with various rewards that rotate weekly.

### Old Arcade Token System (Deprecated):

If you wish to test out our old system, Arcade Tokens can still be used in our ecosystem to play [WEN Game](./wen-game).

You do not need to own a [DEGEN NFT](/docs/overview/nfts/degens/about) to play WEN Game, all you need is an Arcade Token (1 Arcade Token = 1 play).

**Earning Arcade Tokens is based on 2D Nifty Smashers gameplay:**  
DEGEN Owners earn 4 Arcade Tokens every 24 hours with the completion of at least 1 game of 2D Nifty Smashers.

Arcade Tokens are also sold in packs of 4. 1 pack of Arcade Tokens costs 1,000 NFTL. Arcade Tokens can be purchased using [NFTL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nifty-league) via the [Dashboard](https://app.niftyleague.com/) or directly within the [game](https://app.niftyleague.com/games/wen-game).

Purchasing Arcade Tokens in the Dashboard can be done on (1) [the Games page](https://niftyleague-app.vercel.app/games) by clicking the **Buy Arcade Tokens** button in the WEN Game card, (2) [the Overview page](https://app.niftyleague.com/dashboard), or by clicking the **Buy Tokens** button in the Arcade Token Balance box.

A player must have an Arcade Token balance >0 to enter the WEN Game (after entering the game, additional Arcade Tokens can be purchased directly in-game if desired).

:::danger[ðŸ‘€]

All NFTL spent towards the purchase of Arcade Tokens is burned (removed from circulation).
