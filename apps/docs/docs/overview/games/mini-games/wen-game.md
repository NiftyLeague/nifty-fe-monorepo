WEN Game was the first addition to our mini-game series. While the on-chain version is still available for testing, rewards are no longer active. WEN Game has now been repackaged and introduced in our free-2-play mobile games.

### Game Overview

WEN is a game of timing and reflex. The purpose of the game is to try and hit as many baseballs (launched from a baseball machine) as possible in a row to get a high score, as time goes on the game speed
increases, ramping up the difficulty. The ball machine launches balls at irregular intervals, keeping the player on their toes. Game Over is when the player misses or gets hit by a ball.

### Game Mechanics

#### Select DEGEN

- Select and switch DEGENs you own or are renting by pressing Y on your controller, or C on your keyboard

#### Swinging

- Swing the bat by pressing X on your controller or keyboard

#### Jumping

- Jump by pressing A on your controller, or the space bar on your keyboard

#### Scoring

- One hit = 1 point.

#### Leaderboards

- Currently, Leaderboards are supported for High Score.

### On-Chain Mini-Game (Deprecated)

You do not need to own a DEGEN to play [WEN Game](https://app.niftyleague.com/games/wen-game), all you need is an [Arcade Token](./arcade-tokens) (1 Arcade Token = 1 play). If you do not own a DEGEN you’ll play the game with a dummy DEGEN (tribe assignment is random but all tribes are supported). If you own a DEGEN you’ll be able to play the game with your DEGEN of choice.

Currently, earning Arcade Tokens that can be used to play WEN Game is based on Nifty Smashers gameplay. DEGEN Owners earn 4 Arcade Tokens every 24 hours with the completion of at least 1 game of Nifty Smashers.
