Crypto Winter was the second addition to our mini-game series. While the on-chain version is still available for testing, rewards are no longer active. Crypto Winter has now been repackaged and introduced in our free-2-play mobile games.

### Game Overview

Embark on the challenge of surviving the Crypto Winter in this thrilling mini-game. At first glance, it may seem straightforward, but only the most skilled can endure Pengweevil's relentless barrage of obstacles. Navigate through the perilous onslaught, evading snowballs and treacherous icicles to prolong your survival. Exercise caution, though, as you only have three lives. Strategically maneuver to outlast the challenges and conquer Pengweevil.

Crypto Winter is a high-octane action game that demands precise timing and quick reflexes. Your objective: evade an array of snowballs and hazards hurtling your way. Waves of obstacles intensify the challenge, with each successful dodge earning you a point. Uncover special power-ups during your quest, granting you advantages such as free points or temporary invisibility. How long can you endure the Crypto Winter onslaught and emerge victorious against Pengweevil's icy onslaught?

### On-Chain Mini-Game (Deprecated)

You do not have to own a DEGEN to play [Crypto Winter](https://app.niftyleague.com/games/crypto-winter), all you need is an [Arcade Token](./arcade-tokens) (1 Arcade Token = 1 play). If you do not own a DEGEN you’ll play the game with a dummy DEGEN (tribe assignment is random but all tribes are supported). If you own a DEGEN you’ll be able to play the game with your DEGEN of choice.

Currently, earning Arcade Tokens that can be used to play WEN Game is based on Nifty Smashers gameplay. DEGEN Owners earn 4 Arcade Tokens every 24 hours with the completion of at least 1 game of Nifty Smashers.
