Our team strives to make our games highly competitive and packed full of nostalgia from the halcyon days of retro gaming. In September 2021, we released our first game [Nifty Smashers](./mobile-games/nifty-smashers) on desktop. With this initial release we saw impressive in-game and community engagement, encouraging us to push into the global mobile gaming market in 2023. [Nifty Smashers](./mobile-games/nifty-smashers), serves as a compelling testament to our capabilities and expertise. Platform fighting games represent a strong niche that one might assume is already saturated in the market. However, a thorough exploration of the mobile gaming landscape reveals a very limited selection of legit platform fighter games, even more so in Web3. The varying quality between example games underscores the challenge: the steep barrier to entry given the complexity of network solutions and overall domain expertise. While teams can hire talent, these qualifications are not often easy to come by.

[Nifty Royale](./mobile-games/nifty-royale) is up next for 2024, being our first mobile title in collaboration with a third-party game studio. The game is built on top of our mobile framework and uses the emersive environments we built for [NiftyVerse](./niftyverse). Leveraging our comprehensive framework, our first partner studio was quickly able to develop yet another top-tier mobile gaming experience for our platform.

While Nifty League and partner studios push to introduce more standalone game titles, [NiftyVerse](./niftyverse) stands at the heart of our ecosystem tying everything together. It's not only the central lobby system or launch point for many of these games, but the main hub for all social interactions (and quite frankly our biggest game in and of itself). It's an open-world metaverse centered around nostalgia. The [NiftyVerse](./niftyverse) along with our expanding collection of games encourage communities to spend time connecting, gaming, and owning in Web3.
