- Choose to be the line umpire and make important calls
- Be an audience member and emote from the crowd
- Discord voice integration for both players and audience
- Play on a variety of court surfaces in unique stages
- Equip different racquets & items for a temporary tactical advantage
- Compete for the Nifty League Grand Slam Cup

Old school classics are core to our game offerings as we recognize the power of reliving childhood favorites with a Web3 twist. Own your characters & karts and get ready to race for NFTL!
