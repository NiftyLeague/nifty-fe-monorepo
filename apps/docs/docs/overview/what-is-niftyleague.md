Nifty League prides itself on being pioneers in decentralized game development as one of the first community-governed game studios! But what does that even mean?

### Being an indie game developer is difficult, we understand.

Coming from Activision previously and working on several independent mobile games, our team has seen both sides of the aisle. Working as an indie game developer offers creative freedom and autonomy, allowing developers to pursue their vision without external pressures. However, challenges arise in terms of limited resources, including funding, manpower, and access to marketing channels.

On the other hand, collaborating with traditional game publishers can provide financial stability, expertise, and wider distribution networks. Yet, it can come at the cost of creative control and the risk of compromising the original vision of the game due to publisher demands. It’s also often not that rewarding for developers as revenue-sharing agreements heavily favor the publisher.

### What are we building?

The core ethos of our platform revolves around ease of use, enabling developers to use our engaging IP and access our robust tooling to expedite the game development process. Complex undertakings such as networking and progression systems are readily available for developers to tap into and cut their needs substantially.

Benefit from our battle-tested mobile framework and progression system, effortlessly adaptable to any game. Recognizing the pivotal role of retention in a game's success, we prioritize it diligently within our system, ensuring a swift path to monetization for your game. As a third-party developer partnering with us, concentrate on perfecting your core gameplay, confident that we have all other aspects and complexities covered.

We offer seven versatile characters, each with its own unique identity, and ready to integrate seamlessly into any game complemented by a full animation system. We also have the ability to swiftly integrate third-party IPs for added flexibility.

All these resources converge to create an environment where developers can excel at what they do best —crafting captivating games— efficiently and effectively.

### Web3 upbringing

Development started in March 2021 after our team caught on to early rumblings in web3 gaming. At the time we noticed playable options were slim and there was demand for qualified developers to build fun experiences. The industry as a whole favored hype and flashy trailers which are far simpler accomplishments than building fun games. Nifty League took it upon themselves to try to fix this stained image others left and lead by creating high-quality products to stand out from the noise.

But we are well aware, in Web3 it’s often hard to separate the signal from the noise. Things move fast and it can seem like there is a new hyped project for every day of the week. While some projects lean into the hype, flaunting inflated vanity metrics like followers and Discord stats, Nifty League puts its full energy behind creating quality games and letting the numbers speak for themselves.

### Nifty League's vision

Our vision is ultimately to decentralize the green-light, funding, and publishing processes of games. Ongoing efforts are geared towards establishing Nifty League as a game studio of unparalleled quality and player experience in hopes to inspire other indie game studios to build a decentralized future with us.

With our team and our community behind us, Nifty League plans to be the go-to platform for crowdfunding and getting immediate feedback on your next game ideas.
