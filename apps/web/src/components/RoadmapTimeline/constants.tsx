          Welcome to the NiftyVerse; a world filled with DEGENs and NFT communities alike with a shared vision to have
          fun and build a thriving gaming ecosystem. What makes the Niftyverse stand apart from other metaverses is our
          games being the centerpiece. Walk into our arcade room filled with fun mini-games or venture to destinations
          on the map to jump into our classic titles like Nifty Smashers and Nifty Kart.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Nifty League focuses on building a decentralized game platform with titles such as Nifty Smashers and
          other Nintendo-inspired games, NiftyVerse stands at the heart of our ecosystem tying everything together.
          It&apos;s not only the central lobby system or launch point for many of these games, but the main hub for all
          social interactions (and quite frankly our biggest game in and of itself).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          If you&apos;re a creative type, don&apos;t miss this opportunity - we will have an asset store for you to
          design assets such as buildings or trees and list them for sale based on your defined limits and pricing. Do
          you want a cool DEGEN theme park or Cyber Kongz meetup? Build out the NiftyVerse to whatever your heart
          desires!
