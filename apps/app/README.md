# Nifty League App

## Deployments

- main: [app.niftyleague.com](https://app.niftyleague.com)
- staging: [staging.app.niftyleague.com](https://staging.app.niftyleague.com)

## Info

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/**/*`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To create [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers) add an `api/` directory to the `app/` directory with a `route.ts` file. For individual endpoints, create a subfolder in the `api` directory, like `api/hello/route.ts` would map to [http://localhost:3001/api/hello](http://localhost:3001/api/hello).
